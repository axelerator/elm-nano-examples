This folder contains a little experimental _hot code replacment_ setup.

**Tested only under MacOS**

By polling a file generated by the compiler the browser will detect a new version or compiler errors and reload the page content.

By executing the following line the `bin/build.sh` will continously watch and recompile your code in the `src` folder:

```
fswatch -o --event PlatformSpecific -0 src/**/*.elm |  xargs -0 -n1 -I{} ./bin/build.sh
```
